   These are the parameters that are within this object. We can use them as needed.
   Notes:
    (1). these are decimal places, floating values or double. In reality when we talk
        about pixels these numbers should be integers. SOLUTION: We convert this values
        to integers.
    (2). the object type detected is represented by a number (our case 77 which means keyboard using
        the SSD-mobile-network-v2)
        This value represents the position value of the object in the network file.
        We have to find the corresponding name of the class.
